		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, in the Yuddhakanda, mentions a bridge constructed by the god Rama with aid from an army  
		 of Vanaras (monkeys or forest-dwellers) to reach the island Lanka and rescue his wife Sita from Ravana.In popular belief, Lanka is  equated to present-day Sri Lanka.<br>
		
 
 However, such a correspondence is not explicit in the Ramayana and a few verses can even be held to be against such an identification  some Sanskrit 
sourcesof the first millennium emphasize on the distinction.That said, Robert P. Goldman — acclaimed for his editorship of the Princeton translation of   
	the epic into English — characterizes most of the Ramayana, including the LankaKanda, as "kind of [an] elaborate fairy tale" by design; attempts to probe 
	into its historicity were misguided.John Brockington, noted for his scholarship on Hindu epics, concurs<br>
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In extant historical sources, the equation between the two islands appears for the first time only in the Kasakudi Copper Plates of Nandivarman II (r. late-8th century) pertaining 
	to the conquest of Sri Lanka by one of his ancestors; as Ramayana took a life of its own under the succeeding Cholas, the identification profferred, justifying their imperial ambitions to invade the island.

		 then be co-opted by the Aryacakravarti dynasty of Jaffna in presenting themselves as the guardians of the bridge.Nonetheless, two reputed medieval commentaries on the Ramayana — Ramanujiya (drafted c. 1500 by Ramanuja)
		 and Tattvadipika (drafted c. 1550 by Mahesvaratirtha) — continued to make a distinction between Lanka and Sri Lanka.
